Born in Les Cayes, Haiti, in 1785, Audubon was raised in France and studied art under French artist Jacques-Louis David. After settling on his father's Pennsylvania estate at the age of eighteen, he first began to study and paint birds.<\/p><p><br>In his young adulthood, Audubon undertook numerous enterprises, generally without a tremendous amount of success; at various times during his life he was involved in a mercantile business, a lumber and grist mill, a taxidermy business, and a school. His general <strong>mode (A2) <\/strong>of operating a business was to leave it either unattended or in the hands of a partner and take off on excursions through the wilds to paint the natural life that he saw. His business career came to an end in 1819 when he was jailed for debt and forced to file for bankruptcy.<\/p><p><br>It was at that time that Audubon began to seriously <strong>pursue (A3) <\/strong>the dream of publishing a collection of his paintings of birds. For the next six years he painted birds in their natural habitats while his wife worked as a teacher to <strong>support (A4) <\/strong>the family. His Birds of America, which included engravings of 435 of his colorful and lifelike watercolors, was published in parts during the period from 1826 to 1838 in England. After the success of the English editions, American editions of his work were published in 1839, and his fame and fortune were ensured.<\/p>","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T13:40:30.000000Z"}}}

Born in Les Cayes, Haiti, in 1785, Audubon was raised in France and studied art under French artist Jacques-Louis David. After settling on his father's Pennsylvania estate at the age of eighteen, he first began to study and paint birds.<\/p><p><br>In his young adulthood, Audubon undertook numerous enterprises, generally without a tremendous amount of success; at various times during his life he was involved in a mercantile business, a lumber and grist mill, a taxidermy business, and a school. His general <strong>mode (A2) <\/strong>of operating a business was to leave it either unattended or in the hands of a partner and take off on excursions through the wilds to paint the natural life that he saw. His business career came to an end in 1819 when he was jailed for debt and forced to file for bankruptcy.<\/p><p><br>It was at that time that Audubon began to seriously <strong>pursue (A3) <\/strong>the dream of publishing a collection of his paintings of birds.

A second full moon is not called a blue moon because it is particularly blue or is any different in <strong>hue (C1) <\/strong>from the first full moon of the month. Instead, it is called a blue moon because it is so rare. The moon needs a little more than 29 days to complete the cycle from full moon to full moon. Because every month except February has more than 29 days, every month will have at least one full moon (except February. which will have a full moon unless there is a full moon at the very end of January and another full moon at the very beginning of March).

In winter, the air temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is not extremely great, and the temperature of the rising air mass drops more slowly. During these colder months, the atmosphere, therefore, tends to remain rather stable. In summer, however, when there is a high accumulation of heat near the earth's surface, in direct contrast to the considerably colder air higher up, the temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is much more pronounced. As warm air rises in this type of environment, the temperature drops much more rapidly than it does in winter; when the temperature drops more than four degrees Fahrenheit per thousand feet of altitude, cumulus clouds aggregate into a single massive cumulonimbus cloud or thunderhead.<\/p><p>In isolation, a single thunderstorm is an impressive but fairly <strong>benign (E2) <\/strong>way for Mother Earth to defuse trapped heat from her surface; thunderstorms, however, can appear <strong>in concert (E3)<\/strong>, and the resulting show, while extremely impressive, can also prove extraordinarily destructive.

A squall line, which can be hundreds of miles long and can contain fifty distinct thunderheads, is a magnificent force of nature with incredible potential for destruction.

Born in Les Cayes, Haiti, in 1785, Audubon was raised in France and studied art under French artist Jacques-Louis David. After settling on his father's Pennsylvania estate at the age of eighteen, he first began to study and paint birds.<\/p><p><br>In his young adulthood, Audubon undertook numerous enterprises, generally without a tremendous amount of success; at various times during his life he was involved in a mercantile business, a lumber and grist mill, a taxidermy business, and a school. His general <strong>mode (A2) <\/strong>of operating a business was to leave it either unattended or in the hands of a partner and take off on excursions through the wilds to paint the natural life that he saw. His business career came to an end in 1819 when he was jailed for debt and forced to file for bankruptcy.<\/p><p><br>It was at that time that Audubon began to seriously <strong>pursue (A3) <\/strong>the dream of publishing a collection of his paintings of birds.

Experts point out, however, that the mixed breed known as the killer bee is actually not at all as aggressive as the pure African bee. <strong>They (B3) <\/strong>also point out that the attacks have a chemical cause. A killer bee stings only when it has been disturbed; it is not aggressive by nature'. However, after a disturbed bee stings and flies away, it leaves its stinger embedded in the victim. In the vicera attached to the embedded stinger is the chemical isoamyl acetate, which has an odor that attracts other bees. As other bees approach the victim of the original sting, the victim tends to panic, thus disturbing other bees and causing them to sting. The new stings create more of the chemical isoamyl acetate, which attracts more bees and increases the panic level of the victim. Killer bees tend to travel in large clusters or swarms and thus respond in large numbers to the production of isoamyl acetate<br>&nbsp;<\/p>","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T14:11:21.000000Z"},"exam_questions":[{"id":184,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"It is stated in the passage that killer bees","option_1":"are more deadly than African bees","option_2":"are less aggressive than African bees","option_3":"never attack animals","option_4":"always attack African bees","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","exam_result":[]},{"id":185,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p>The pronoun \"They\" <strong>(B3)<\/strong> refers to<\/p>","option_1":"killer bees","option_2":"humans and animals","option_3":"fatalities","option_4":"experts","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T23:04:09.000000Z","exam_result":[]},{"id":186,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"What is NOT mentioned in the passage as a contributing factor in an attack by killer bees?","option_1":"Panic by the victim","option_2":"An odorous chemical","option_3":"Disturbance of the bees","option_4":"Inclement weather","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","exam_result":[]},{"id":187,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p><strong>(L1)<\/strong> <i>Killer bees are reputed to be extremely aggressive in nature, although experts say that their aggression may have been somewhat inflated.<\/i><\/p><p><strong>(L2)<\/strong> <i>The killer bee is a hybrid \u2013 or combination \u2013 of the very mild European strain of honeybee and the considerably more aggressive African bee, which was created when the African strain was imported into Brazil in 1955.<\/i><\/p><p><strong>(L3)<\/strong> <i>These killer bees have been known to attack humans and animals, and some fatalities have occurred.<\/i><\/p><p><strong>(L4)<\/strong> <i>Killer bees tend to travel in large clusters or swarms and thus respond in large numbers to the production of isoamyl acetate.<\/i><\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Where in the passage does the author describe the size of the groups in which killer bees move?<\/p>","option_1":"L1","option_2":"L2","option_3":"L3","option_4":"L4","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T23:15:42.000000Z","exam_result":[]}]}}

A thunderstorm starts when low-lying pockets of warm air from the surface of the earth begin to rise. The pockets of warm air float upward through the air above that is both cooler and heavier. The rising pockets cool as their pressure decreases, and their latent heat is released above the condensation line through the formation of cumulus clouds.<\/p><p>What will happen with these clouds depends on the temperature of the atmosphere. In winter, the air temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is not extremely great, and the temperature of the rising air mass drops more slowly. During these colder months, the atmosphere, therefore, tends to remain rather stable. In summer, however, when there is a high accumulation of heat near the earth's surface, in direct contrast to the considerably colder air higher up, the temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is much more pronounced. As warm air rises in this type of environment, the temperature drops much more rapidly than it does in winter; when the temperature drops more than four degrees Fahrenheit per thousand feet of altitude, cumulus clouds aggregate into a single massive cumulonimbus cloud or thunderhead.<\/p><p>In isolation, a single thunderstorm is an impressive but fairly <strong>benign (E2) <\/strong>way for Mother Earth to defuse trapped heat from her surface; thunderstorms, however, can appear <strong>in concert (E3)<\/strong>, and the resulting show, while extremely impressive, can also prove extraordinarily destructive. When there is a large-scale collision between cold air and warm air masses during the summer months, <strong>a squall line (E4)<\/strong>, or series of thunderheads, may develop. It is common for a squall line to begin when an advancing cold front meets up with and forces <strong>itself (E5) <\/strong>under a layer of warm and moist air, creating a line of thunderstorms that races forward at speeds of approximately forty miles per hour. A squall line, which can be hundreds of miles long and can contain fifty distinct thunderheads, is a magnificent force of nature with incredible potential for destruction. Within the squall line, often near its southern end, can be found supercells, long-lived rotating storms of exceptional strength that serve as the source of tornadoes.<br>&nbsp;<\/p>","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T15:11:01.000000Z"},"exam_questions":[{"id":209,"group_question_id":69,"list_question_id":19,"question":"The topic of the passage is","option_1":"the development of thunderstorms and squall lines","option_2":"the devastating effects of tornadoes","option_3":"cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds","option_4":"the power of tornadoes","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","exam_result":[]},{"id":210,"group_question_id":69,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p>\"Mechanisms\" <strong>(E1)<\/strong> are most likely<\/p>","option_1":"machines","option_2":"motions","option_3":"methods","option_4":"materials","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T00:12:26.000000Z","exam_result":[]},{"id":211,"group_question_id":69,"list_question_id":19,"question":"It can be inferred from the passage that, in summer,","option_1":"there is not a great temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes","option_2":"the greater temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes makes thunderstorms more likely to occur","option_3":"there is not much cold air higher up in the atmosphere","option_4":"the temperature of rising air drops more slowly than it does in winter","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","exam_result":[]}]}}

A thunderstorm starts when low-lying pockets of warm air from the surface of the earth begin to rise. The pockets of warm air float upward through the air above that is both cooler and heavier. The rising pockets cool as their pressure decreases, and their latent heat is released above the condensation line through the formation of cumulus clouds.<\/p><p>What will happen with these clouds depends on the temperature of the atmosphere. In winter, the air temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is not extremely great, and the temperature of the rising air mass drops more slowly. During these colder months, the atmosphere, therefore, tends to remain rather stable. In summer, however, when there is a high accumulation of heat near the earth's surface, in direct contrast to the considerably colder air higher up, the temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is much more pronounced. As warm air rises in this type of environment, the temperature drops much more rapidly than it does in winter; when the temperature drops more than four degrees Fahrenheit per thousand feet of altitude, cumulus clouds aggregate into a single massive cumulonimbus cloud or thunderhead.<\/p><p>In isolation, a single thunderstorm is an impressive but fairly <strong>benign (E2) <\/strong>way for Mother Earth to defuse trapped heat from her surface; thunderstorms, however, can appear <strong>in concert (E3)<\/strong>, and the resulting show, while extremely impressive, can also prove extraordinarily destructive. When there is a large-scale collision between cold air and warm air masses during the summer months, <strong>a squall line (E4)<\/strong>, or series of thunderheads, may develop. It is common for a squall line to begin when an advancing cold front meets up with and forces <strong>itself (E5) <\/strong>under a layer of warm and moist air, creating a line of thunderstorms that races forward at speeds of approximately forty miles per hour. A squall line, which can be hundreds of miles long and can contain fifty distinct thunderheads, is a magnificent force of nature with incredible potential for destruction. Within the squall line, often near its southern end, can be found supercells, long-lived rotating storms of exceptional strength that serve as the source of tornadoes.<br>&nbsp;<\/p>","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T15:11:33.000000Z"},"exam_questions":[{"id":212,"group_question_id":70,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p>The word \"benign\" <strong>(E2)<\/strong> is closest in meaning to<\/p>","option_1":"harmless","option_2":"beneficial","option_3":"ferocious","option_4":"spectacular","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T00:12:53.000000Z","exam_result":[]},{"id":213,"group_question_id":70,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p>The expression \"in concert\" <strong>(E3)<\/strong> could best be replaced by<\/p>","option_1":"as a chorus","option_2":"with other musicians","option_3":"as a cluster","option_4":"in a performance","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T00:13:25.000000Z","exam_result":[]},{"id":214,"group_question_id":70,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p>According to the passage, a \"squall line\" <strong>(E4)<\/strong> is<\/p>","option_1":"a lengthy cold front","option_2":"a serious thunderstorm","option_3":"a line of supercells","option_4":"a string of thunderheads","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T00:14:14.000000Z","exam_result":[]}]}}

Killer bees are reputed to be extremely aggressive in nature, although experts say that their aggression may have been somewhat <strong>inflated (B1)<\/strong>.<\/p><p><br>The killer bee is a <strong>hybrid (B2) <\/strong>\u2013 or combination \u2013 of the very mild European strain of honeybee and the considerably more aggressive African bee, which was created when the African strain was imported into Brazil in 1955. The African bees were brought into Brazil because their aggression was considered an advantage: they were far more productive than their European counterparts in that they spent a higher percentage of their time working and continued working longer in inclement weather than did the European bees.<\/p><p><br>These killer bees have been known to attack humans and animals, and some fatalities have occurred. Experts point out, however, that the mixed breed known as the killer bee is actually not at all as aggressive as the pure African bee. <strong>They (B3) <\/strong>also point out that the attacks have a chemical cause. A killer bee stings only when it has been disturbed; it is not aggressive by nature'. However, after a disturbed bee stings and flies away, it leaves its stinger embedded in the victim. In the vicera attached to the embedded stinger is the chemical isoamyl acetate, which has an odor that attracts other bees. As other bees approach the victim of the original sting, the victim tends to panic, thus disturbing other bees and causing them to sting. The new stings create more of the chemical isoamyl acetate, which attracts more bees and increases the panic level of the victim. Killer bees tend to travel in large clusters or swarms and thus respond in large numbers to the production of isoamyl acetate<br>&nbsp;<\/p>","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T14:11:21.000000Z"},"exam_questions":[{"id":184,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"It is stated in the passage that killer bees","option_1":"are more deadly than African bees","option_2":"are less aggressive than African bees","option_3":"never attack animals","option_4":"always attack African bees","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","exam_result":[]},{"id":185,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p>The pronoun \"They\" <strong>(B3)<\/strong> refers to<\/p>","option_1":"killer bees","option_2":"humans and animals","option_3":"fatalities","option_4":"experts","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T23:04:09.000000Z","exam_result":[]},{"id":186,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"What is NOT mentioned in the passage as a contributing factor in an attack by killer bees?","option_1":"Panic by the victim","option_2":"An odorous chemical","option_3":"Disturbance of the bees","option_4":"Inclement weather","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","exam_result":[]},{"id":187,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p><strong>(L1)<\/strong> <i>Killer bees are reputed to be extremely aggressive in nature, although experts say that their aggression may have been somewhat inflated.<\/i><\/p><p><strong>(L2)<\/strong> <i>The killer bee is a hybrid \u2013 or combination \u2013 of the very mild European strain of honeybee and the considerably more aggressive African bee, which was created when the African strain was imported into Brazil in 1955.<\/i><\/p><p><strong>(L3)<\/strong> <i>These killer bees have been known to attack humans and animals, and some fatalities have occurred.<\/i><\/p><p><strong>(L4)<\/strong> <i>Killer bees tend to travel in large clusters or swarms and thus respond in large numbers to the production of isoamyl acetate.<\/i><\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Where in the passage does the author describe the size of the groups in which killer bees move?<\/p>","option_1":"L1","option_2":"L2","option_3":"L3","option_4":"L4","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T23:15:42.000000Z","exam_result":[]}],"is_last_category":true}}

Italian American A.P. Giannini established this bank on October 17, 1904, in a renovated saloon in San Francisco's Italian community of North Beach under the name Bank of Italy, with immigrants and first-time bank customers comprising the majority of his first customers. During its development, Giannini's bank survived major crises in the form of a natural disaster and a major economic upheaval that not all other banks were able to overcome.<\/p><p>One major test for Giannini's bank occurred on April 18, 1906, when a massive earthquake struck San Francisco, followed by a <strong>raging (D1) <\/strong>fire that destroyed much of the city. Giannini obtained two wagons and teams of horses, filled the wagons with the bank's reserves, mostly in the form of gold, covered the reserves with crates of oranges, and escaped from the <strong>chaos (D2) <\/strong>of the city with his clients' funds protected. In the aftermath of the disaster, Giannini's bank was the first to resume operations. Unable to install the bank in a proper office setting, Giannini opened up shop on the Washington Street Wharf on a makeshift desk created from boards and barrels.<\/p><p>In the period following the 1906 fire, the Bank of Italy continued to prosper and expand. By 1918 there were twenty-four branches of the Bank of Italy, and by 1928 Giannini had acquired numerous other banks, including a Bank of America located in New York City. In 1930 he <strong>consolidated (D3) <\/strong>all the branches of the Bank of Italy, the Bank of America in New York City, and another Bank of America that he had formed in California into the Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association.<\/p><p>A second major crisis for the bank occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
