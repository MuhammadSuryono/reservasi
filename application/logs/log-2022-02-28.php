When people say that something happens \"only once in a blue moon: they mean that it happens only very rarely, once in a great while. This expression has been around for at least a century and a half; there are references to this expression that date from the second half of the nineteenth century.<\/p><p>The expression \"a blue moon\" has come to refer to the second full moon occurring in any given calendar month. A second full moon is not called a blue moon because it is particularly blue or is any different in <strong>hue (C1) <\/strong>from the first full moon of the month. Instead, it is called a blue moon because it is so rare. The moon needs a little more than 29 days to complete the cycle from full moon to full moon. Because every month except February has more than 29 days, every month will have at least one full moon (except February. which will have a full moon unless there is a full moon at the very end of January and another full moon at the very beginning of March). It is on the occasion when a given calendar month has a second full moon that a blue moon occurs. This does not happen very often, only three or four times in a decade.<\/p><p>The blue moons of today are called blue moons because of their rarity and not because of their color; however. The expression \"blue moon\" may have come into existence in reference to unusual circumstances in which the moon actually appeared blue. Certain natural phenomena of gigantic proportions can actually change the appearance of the moon from Earth.

Italian American A.P. Giannini established this bank on October 17, 1904, in a renovated saloon in San Francisco's Italian community of North Beach under the name Bank of Italy, with immigrants and first-time bank customers comprising the majority of his first customers. During its development, Giannini's bank survived major crises in the form of a natural disaster and a major economic upheaval that not all other banks were able to overcome.<\/p><p>One major test for Giannini's bank occurred on April 18, 1906, when a massive earthquake struck San Francisco, followed by a <strong>raging (D1) <\/strong>fire that destroyed much of the city. Giannini obtained two wagons and teams of horses, filled the wagons with the bank's reserves, mostly in the form of gold, covered the reserves with crates of oranges, and escaped from the <strong>chaos (D2) <\/strong>of the city with his clients' funds protected. In the aftermath of the disaster, Giannini's bank was the first to resume operations. Unable to install the bank in a proper office setting, Giannini opened up shop on the Washington Street Wharf on a makeshift desk created from boards and barrels.<\/p><p>In the period following the 1906 fire, the Bank of Italy continued to prosper and expand. By 1918 there were twenty-four branches of the Bank of Italy, and by 1928 Giannini had acquired numerous other banks, including a Bank of America located in New York City. In 1930 he <strong>consolidated (D3) <\/strong>all the branches of the Bank of Italy, the Bank of America in New York City, and another Bank of America that he had formed in California into the Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association.<\/p><p>A second major crisis for the bank occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Although Giannini had already retired prior to the darkest days of the Depression, he became incensed when his successor began selling off banks during the bad economic times. Giannini resumed leadership of the bank at the age of sixty-two. Under Giannini's leadership, the bank <strong>weathered the storm of (D4)<\/strong> the Depression and subsequently moved into a phase of overseas development.<br>&nbsp;<\/p>","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T14:54:44.000000Z"},"exam_questions":[{"id":197,"group_question_id":65,"list_question_id":19,"question":"29.

A thunderstorm starts when low-lying pockets of warm air from the surface of the earth begin to rise. The pockets of warm air float upward through the air above that is both cooler and heavier. The rising pockets cool as their pressure decreases, and their latent heat is released above the condensation line through the formation of cumulus clouds.<\/p><p>What will happen with these clouds depends on the temperature of the atmosphere. In winter, the air temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is not extremely great, and the temperature of the rising air mass drops more slowly. During these colder months, the atmosphere, therefore, tends to remain rather stable. In summer, however, when there is a high accumulation of heat near the earth's surface, in direct contrast to the considerably colder air higher up, the temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is much more pronounced. As warm air rises in this type of environment, the temperature drops much more rapidly than it does in winter; when the temperature drops more than four degrees Fahrenheit per thousand feet of altitude, cumulus clouds aggregate into a single massive cumulonimbus cloud or thunderhead.<\/p><p>In isolation, a single thunderstorm is an impressive but fairly <strong>benign (E2) <\/strong>way for Mother Earth to defuse trapped heat from her surface; thunderstorms, however, can appear <strong>in concert (E3)<\/strong>, and the resulting show, while extremely impressive, can also prove extraordinarily destructive. When there is a large-scale collision between cold air and warm air masses during the summer months, <strong>a squall line (E4)<\/strong>, or series of thunderheads, may develop.

Experts point out, however, that the mixed breed known as the killer bee is actually not at all as aggressive as the pure African bee. <strong>They (B3) <\/strong>also point out that the attacks have a chemical cause. A killer bee stings only when it has been disturbed; it is not aggressive by nature'. However, after a disturbed bee stings and flies away, it leaves its stinger embedded in the victim. In the vicera attached to the embedded stinger is the chemical isoamyl acetate, which has an odor that attracts other bees. As other bees approach the victim of the original sting, the victim tends to panic, thus disturbing other bees and causing them to sting. The new stings create more of the chemical isoamyl acetate, which attracts more bees and increases the panic level of the victim. Killer bees tend to travel in large clusters or swarms and thus respond in large numbers to the production of isoamyl acetate<br>&nbsp;<\/p>","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T14:11:21.000000Z","sequence_exam":[{"id_exam":184,"sequence":16},{"id_exam":185,"sequence":17},{"id_exam":186,"sequence":18},{"id_exam":187,"sequence":19}],"question":[{"id":184,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"It is stated in the passage that killer bees","option_1":"are more deadly than African bees","option_2":"are less aggressive than African bees","option_3":"never attack animals","option_4":"always attack African bees","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z"},{"id":185,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p>The pronoun \"They\" <strong>(B3)<\/strong> refers to<\/p>","option_1":"killer bees","option_2":"humans and animals","option_3":"fatalities","option_4":"experts","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T23:04:09.000000Z"},{"id":186,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"What is NOT mentioned in the passage as a contributing factor in an attack by killer bees?","option_1":"Panic by the victim","option_2":"An odorous chemical","option_3":"Disturbance of the bees","option_4":"Inclement weather","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z"},{"id":187,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p><strong>(L1)<\/strong> <i>Killer bees are reputed to be extremely aggressive in nature, although experts say that their aggression may have been somewhat inflated.<\/i><\/p><p><strong>(L2)<\/strong> <i>The killer bee is a hybrid \u2013 or combination \u2013 of the very mild European strain of honeybee and the considerably more aggressive African bee, which was created when the African strain was imported into Brazil in 1955.<\/i><\/p><p><strong>(L3)<\/strong> <i>These killer bees have been known to attack humans and animals, and some fatalities have occurred.<\/i><\/p><p><strong>(L4)<\/strong> <i>Killer bees tend to travel in large clusters or swarms and thus respond in large numbers to the production of isoamyl acetate.<\/i><\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Where in the passage does the author describe the size of the groups in which killer bees move?<\/p>","option_1":"L1","option_2":"L2","option_3":"L3","option_4":"L4","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T23:15:42.000000Z"}]},{"id":62,"list_question_id":19,"name":"R3A","description":"Questions 20-28","filename_group":"","question_group":"<p>There is a common expression in the English language referring to a blue moon.

During its development, Giannini's bank survived major crises in the form of a natural disaster and a major economic upheaval that not all other banks were able to overcome.<\/p><p>One major test for Giannini's bank occurred on April 18, 1906, when a massive earthquake struck San Francisco, followed by a <strong>raging (D1) <\/strong>fire that destroyed much of the city. Giannini obtained two wagons and teams of horses, filled the wagons with the bank's reserves, mostly in the form of gold, covered the reserves with crates of oranges, and escaped from the <strong>chaos (D2) <\/strong>of the city with his clients' funds protected. In the aftermath of the disaster, Giannini's bank was the first to resume operations.

A second full moon is not called a blue moon because it is particularly blue or is any different in <strong>hue (C1) <\/strong>from the first full moon of the month. Instead, it is called a blue moon because it is so rare. The moon needs a little more than 29 days to complete the cycle from full moon to full moon. Because every month except February has more than 29 days, every month will have at least one full moon (except February. which will have a full moon unless there is a full moon at the very end of January and another full moon at the very beginning of March).

In winter, the air temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is not extremely great, and the temperature of the rising air mass drops more slowly. During these colder months, the atmosphere, therefore, tends to remain rather stable. In summer, however, when there is a high accumulation of heat near the earth's surface, in direct contrast to the considerably colder air higher up, the temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is much more pronounced. As warm air rises in this type of environment, the temperature drops much more rapidly than it does in winter; when the temperature drops more than four degrees Fahrenheit per thousand feet of altitude, cumulus clouds aggregate into a single massive cumulonimbus cloud or thunderhead.<\/p><p>In isolation, a single thunderstorm is an impressive but fairly <strong>benign (E2) <\/strong>way for Mother Earth to defuse trapped heat from her surface; thunderstorms, however, can appear <strong>in concert (E3)<\/strong>, and the resulting show, while extremely impressive, can also prove extraordinarily destructive.

A squall line, which can be hundreds of miles long and can contain fifty distinct thunderheads, is a magnificent force of nature with incredible potential for destruction.

Experts point out, however, that the mixed breed known as the killer bee is actually not at all as aggressive as the pure African bee. <strong>They (B3) <\/strong>also point out that the attacks have a chemical cause. A killer bee stings only when it has been disturbed; it is not aggressive by nature'. However, after a disturbed bee stings and flies away, it leaves its stinger embedded in the victim. In the vicera attached to the embedded stinger is the chemical isoamyl acetate, which has an odor that attracts other bees. As other bees approach the victim of the original sting, the victim tends to panic, thus disturbing other bees and causing them to sting. The new stings create more of the chemical isoamyl acetate, which attracts more bees and increases the panic level of the victim. Killer bees tend to travel in large clusters or swarms and thus respond in large numbers to the production of isoamyl acetate<br>&nbsp;<\/p>","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T14:11:21.000000Z"},"exam_questions":[{"id":184,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"It is stated in the passage that killer bees","option_1":"are more deadly than African bees","option_2":"are less aggressive than African bees","option_3":"never attack animals","option_4":"always attack African bees","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","exam_result":[]},{"id":185,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p>The pronoun \"They\" <strong>(B3)<\/strong> refers to<\/p>","option_1":"killer bees","option_2":"humans and animals","option_3":"fatalities","option_4":"experts","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T23:04:09.000000Z","exam_result":[]},{"id":186,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"What is NOT mentioned in the passage as a contributing factor in an attack by killer bees?","option_1":"Panic by the victim","option_2":"An odorous chemical","option_3":"Disturbance of the bees","option_4":"Inclement weather","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","exam_result":[]},{"id":187,"group_question_id":61,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p><strong>(L1)<\/strong> <i>Killer bees are reputed to be extremely aggressive in nature, although experts say that their aggression may have been somewhat inflated.<\/i><\/p><p><strong>(L2)<\/strong> <i>The killer bee is a hybrid \u2013 or combination \u2013 of the very mild European strain of honeybee and the considerably more aggressive African bee, which was created when the African strain was imported into Brazil in 1955.<\/i><\/p><p><strong>(L3)<\/strong> <i>These killer bees have been known to attack humans and animals, and some fatalities have occurred.<\/i><\/p><p><strong>(L4)<\/strong> <i>Killer bees tend to travel in large clusters or swarms and thus respond in large numbers to the production of isoamyl acetate.<\/i><\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Where in the passage does the author describe the size of the groups in which killer bees move?<\/p>","option_1":"L1","option_2":"L2","option_3":"L3","option_4":"L4","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T23:15:42.000000Z","exam_result":[]}],"is_last_category":true}}
