Born in Les Cayes, Haiti, in 1785, Audubon was raised in France and studied art under French artist Jacques-Louis David. After settling on his father's Pennsylvania estate at the age of eighteen, he first began to study and paint birds.<\/p><p><br>In his young adulthood, Audubon undertook numerous enterprises, generally without a tremendous amount of success; at various times during his life he was involved in a mercantile business, a lumber and grist mill, a taxidermy business, and a school. His general <strong>mode (A2) <\/strong>of operating a business was to leave it either unattended or in the hands of a partner and take off on excursions through the wilds to paint the natural life that he saw. His business career came to an end in 1819 when he was jailed for debt and forced to file for bankruptcy.<\/p><p><br>It was at that time that Audubon began to seriously <strong>pursue (A3) <\/strong>the dream of publishing a collection of his paintings of birds.

A second full moon is not called a blue moon because it is particularly blue or is any different in <strong>hue (C1) <\/strong>from the first full moon of the month. Instead, it is called a blue moon because it is so rare. The moon needs a little more than 29 days to complete the cycle from full moon to full moon. Because every month except February has more than 29 days, every month will have at least one full moon (except February. which will have a full moon unless there is a full moon at the very end of January and another full moon at the very beginning of March).

In winter, the air temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is not extremely great, and the temperature of the rising air mass drops more slowly. During these colder months, the atmosphere, therefore, tends to remain rather stable. In summer, however, when there is a high accumulation of heat near the earth's surface, in direct contrast to the considerably colder air higher up, the temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is much more pronounced. As warm air rises in this type of environment, the temperature drops much more rapidly than it does in winter; when the temperature drops more than four degrees Fahrenheit per thousand feet of altitude, cumulus clouds aggregate into a single massive cumulonimbus cloud or thunderhead.<\/p><p>In isolation, a single thunderstorm is an impressive but fairly <strong>benign (E2) <\/strong>way for Mother Earth to defuse trapped heat from her surface; thunderstorms, however, can appear <strong>in concert (E3)<\/strong>, and the resulting show, while extremely impressive, can also prove extraordinarily destructive.

A squall line, which can be hundreds of miles long and can contain fifty distinct thunderheads, is a magnificent force of nature with incredible potential for destruction.

Born in Les Cayes, Haiti, in 1785, Audubon was raised in France and studied art under French artist Jacques-Louis David. After settling on his father's Pennsylvania estate at the age of eighteen, he first began to study and paint birds.<\/p><p><br>In his young adulthood, Audubon undertook numerous enterprises, generally without a tremendous amount of success; at various times during his life he was involved in a mercantile business, a lumber and grist mill, a taxidermy business, and a school. His general <strong>mode (A2) <\/strong>of operating a business was to leave it either unattended or in the hands of a partner and take off on excursions through the wilds to paint the natural life that he saw. His business career came to an end in 1819 when he was jailed for debt and forced to file for bankruptcy.<\/p><p><br>It was at that time that Audubon began to seriously <strong>pursue (A3) <\/strong>the dream of publishing a collection of his paintings of birds.

A second full moon is not called a blue moon because it is particularly blue or is any different in <strong>hue (C1) <\/strong>from the first full moon of the month. Instead, it is called a blue moon because it is so rare. The moon needs a little more than 29 days to complete the cycle from full moon to full moon. Because every month except February has more than 29 days, every month will have at least one full moon (except February. which will have a full moon unless there is a full moon at the very end of January and another full moon at the very beginning of March).

In winter, the air temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is not extremely great, and the temperature of the rising air mass drops more slowly. During these colder months, the atmosphere, therefore, tends to remain rather stable. In summer, however, when there is a high accumulation of heat near the earth's surface, in direct contrast to the considerably colder air higher up, the temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is much more pronounced. As warm air rises in this type of environment, the temperature drops much more rapidly than it does in winter; when the temperature drops more than four degrees Fahrenheit per thousand feet of altitude, cumulus clouds aggregate into a single massive cumulonimbus cloud or thunderhead.<\/p><p>In isolation, a single thunderstorm is an impressive but fairly <strong>benign (E2) <\/strong>way for Mother Earth to defuse trapped heat from her surface; thunderstorms, however, can appear <strong>in concert (E3)<\/strong>, and the resulting show, while extremely impressive, can also prove extraordinarily destructive.

A squall line, which can be hundreds of miles long and can contain fifty distinct thunderheads, is a magnificent force of nature with incredible potential for destruction.

Born in Les Cayes, Haiti, in 1785, Audubon was raised in France and studied art under French artist Jacques-Louis David. After settling on his father's Pennsylvania estate at the age of eighteen, he first began to study and paint birds.<\/p><p><br>In his young adulthood, Audubon undertook numerous enterprises, generally without a tremendous amount of success; at various times during his life he was involved in a mercantile business, a lumber and grist mill, a taxidermy business, and a school. His general <strong>mode (A2) <\/strong>of operating a business was to leave it either unattended or in the hands of a partner and take off on excursions through the wilds to paint the natural life that he saw. His business career came to an end in 1819 when he was jailed for debt and forced to file for bankruptcy.<\/p><p><br>It was at that time that Audubon began to seriously <strong>pursue (A3) <\/strong>the dream of publishing a collection of his paintings of birds.

A second full moon is not called a blue moon because it is particularly blue or is any different in <strong>hue (C1) <\/strong>from the first full moon of the month. Instead, it is called a blue moon because it is so rare. The moon needs a little more than 29 days to complete the cycle from full moon to full moon. Because every month except February has more than 29 days, every month will have at least one full moon (except February. which will have a full moon unless there is a full moon at the very end of January and another full moon at the very beginning of March).

In winter, the air temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is not extremely great, and the temperature of the rising air mass drops more slowly. During these colder months, the atmosphere, therefore, tends to remain rather stable. In summer, however, when there is a high accumulation of heat near the earth's surface, in direct contrast to the considerably colder air higher up, the temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is much more pronounced. As warm air rises in this type of environment, the temperature drops much more rapidly than it does in winter; when the temperature drops more than four degrees Fahrenheit per thousand feet of altitude, cumulus clouds aggregate into a single massive cumulonimbus cloud or thunderhead.<\/p><p>In isolation, a single thunderstorm is an impressive but fairly <strong>benign (E2) <\/strong>way for Mother Earth to defuse trapped heat from her surface; thunderstorms, however, can appear <strong>in concert (E3)<\/strong>, and the resulting show, while extremely impressive, can also prove extraordinarily destructive.

A squall line, which can be hundreds of miles long and can contain fifty distinct thunderheads, is a magnificent force of nature with incredible potential for destruction.

Born in Les Cayes, Haiti, in 1785, Audubon was raised in France and studied art under French artist Jacques-Louis David. After settling on his father's Pennsylvania estate at the age of eighteen, he first began to study and paint birds.<\/p><p><br>In his young adulthood, Audubon undertook numerous enterprises, generally without a tremendous amount of success; at various times during his life he was involved in a mercantile business, a lumber and grist mill, a taxidermy business, and a school. His general <strong>mode (A2) <\/strong>of operating a business was to leave it either unattended or in the hands of a partner and take off on excursions through the wilds to paint the natural life that he saw. His business career came to an end in 1819 when he was jailed for debt and forced to file for bankruptcy.<\/p><p><br>It was at that time that Audubon began to seriously <strong>pursue (A3) <\/strong>the dream of publishing a collection of his paintings of birds.

A second full moon is not called a blue moon because it is particularly blue or is any different in <strong>hue (C1) <\/strong>from the first full moon of the month. Instead, it is called a blue moon because it is so rare. The moon needs a little more than 29 days to complete the cycle from full moon to full moon. Because every month except February has more than 29 days, every month will have at least one full moon (except February. which will have a full moon unless there is a full moon at the very end of January and another full moon at the very beginning of March).

In winter, the air temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is not extremely great, and the temperature of the rising air mass drops more slowly. During these colder months, the atmosphere, therefore, tends to remain rather stable. In summer, however, when there is a high accumulation of heat near the earth's surface, in direct contrast to the considerably colder air higher up, the temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is much more pronounced. As warm air rises in this type of environment, the temperature drops much more rapidly than it does in winter; when the temperature drops more than four degrees Fahrenheit per thousand feet of altitude, cumulus clouds aggregate into a single massive cumulonimbus cloud or thunderhead.<\/p><p>In isolation, a single thunderstorm is an impressive but fairly <strong>benign (E2) <\/strong>way for Mother Earth to defuse trapped heat from her surface; thunderstorms, however, can appear <strong>in concert (E3)<\/strong>, and the resulting show, while extremely impressive, can also prove extraordinarily destructive.

A squall line, which can be hundreds of miles long and can contain fifty distinct thunderheads, is a magnificent force of nature with incredible potential for destruction.

In winter, the air temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is not extremely great, and the temperature of the rising air mass drops more slowly. During these colder months, the atmosphere, therefore, tends to remain rather stable. In summer, however, when there is a high accumulation of heat near the earth's surface, in direct contrast to the considerably colder air higher up, the temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is much more pronounced. As warm air rises in this type of environment, the temperature drops much more rapidly than it does in winter; when the temperature drops more than four degrees Fahrenheit per thousand feet of altitude, cumulus clouds aggregate into a single massive cumulonimbus cloud or thunderhead.<\/p><p>In isolation, a single thunderstorm is an impressive but fairly <strong>benign (E2) <\/strong>way for Mother Earth to defuse trapped heat from her surface; thunderstorms, however, can appear <strong>in concert (E3)<\/strong>, and the resulting show, while extremely impressive, can also prove extraordinarily destructive. When there is a large-scale collision between cold air and warm air masses during the summer months, <strong>a squall line (E4)<\/strong>, or series of thunderheads, may develop. It is common for a squall line to begin when an advancing cold front meets up with and forces <strong>itself (E5) <\/strong>under a layer of warm and moist air, creating a line of thunderstorms that races forward at speeds of approximately forty miles per hour. A squall line, which can be hundreds of miles long and can contain fifty distinct thunderheads, is a magnificent force of nature with incredible potential for destruction. Within the squall line, often near its southern end, can be found supercells, long-lived rotating storms of exceptional strength that serve as the source of tornadoes.<br>&nbsp;<\/p>","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T15:11:33.000000Z","sequence_exam":[{"id_exam":212,"sequence":44},{"id_exam":213,"sequence":45},{"id_exam":214,"sequence":46}],"question":[{"id":212,"group_question_id":70,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p>The word \"benign\" <strong>(E2)<\/strong> is closest in meaning to<\/p>","option_1":"harmless","option_2":"beneficial","option_3":"ferocious","option_4":"spectacular","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T00:12:53.000000Z"},{"id":213,"group_question_id":70,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p>The expression \"in concert\" <strong>(E3)<\/strong> could best be replaced by<\/p>","option_1":"as a chorus","option_2":"with other musicians","option_3":"as a cluster","option_4":"in a performance","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T00:13:25.000000Z"},{"id":214,"group_question_id":70,"list_question_id":19,"question":"<p>According to the passage, a \"squall line\" <strong>(E4)<\/strong> is<\/p>","option_1":"a lengthy cold front","option_2":"a serious thunderstorm","option_3":"a line of supercells","option_4":"a string of thunderheads","option_5":"","created_at":"2022-02-23T13:26:16.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T00:14:14.000000Z"}]},{"id":71,"list_question_id":19,"name":"R5C","description":"Questions 41-50","filename_group":"","question_group":"<p>Thunderstorms, with their jagged bursts of lightning and roaring thunder, are actually one of nature's primary <strong>mechanisms (E1) <\/strong>for transferring heat from the surface of the earth into the atmosphere.

A thunderstorm starts when low-lying pockets of warm air from the surface of the earth begin to rise. The pockets of warm air float upward through the air above that is both cooler and heavier. The rising pockets cool as their pressure decreases, and their latent heat is released above the condensation line through the formation of cumulus clouds.<\/p><p>What will happen with these clouds depends on the temperature of the atmosphere. In winter, the air temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is not extremely great, and the temperature of the rising air mass drops more slowly. During these colder months, the atmosphere, therefore, tends to remain rather stable. In summer, however, when there is a high accumulation of heat near the earth's surface, in direct contrast to the considerably colder air higher up, the temperature differential between higher and lower altitudes is much more pronounced. As warm air rises in this type of environment, the temperature drops much more rapidly than it does in winter; when the temperature drops more than four degrees Fahrenheit per thousand feet of altitude, cumulus clouds aggregate into a single massive cumulonimbus cloud or thunderhead.<\/p><p>In isolation, a single thunderstorm is an impressive but fairly <strong>benign (E2) <\/strong>way for Mother Earth to defuse trapped heat from her surface; thunderstorms, however, can appear <strong>in concert (E3)<\/strong>, and the resulting show, while extremely impressive, can also prove extraordinarily destructive. When there is a large-scale collision between cold air and warm air masses during the summer months, <strong>a squall line (E4)<\/strong>, or series of thunderheads, may develop. It is common for a squall line to begin when an advancing cold front meets up with and forces <strong>itself (E5) <\/strong>under a layer of warm and moist air, creating a line of thunderstorms that races forward at speeds of approximately forty miles per hour. A squall line, which can be hundreds of miles long and can contain fifty distinct thunderheads, is a magnificent force of nature with incredible potential for destruction.

Killer bees are reputed to be extremely aggressive in nature, although experts say that their aggression may have been somewhat <strong>inflated (B1)<\/strong>.<\/p><p><br>The killer bee is a <strong>hybrid (B2) <\/strong>\u2013 or combination \u2013 of the very mild European strain of honeybee and the considerably more aggressive African bee, which was created when the African strain was imported into Brazil in 1955. The African bees were brought into Brazil because their aggression was considered an advantage: they were far more productive than their European counterparts in that they spent a higher percentage of their time working and continued working longer in inclement weather than did the European bees.<\/p><p><br>These killer bees have been known to attack humans and animals, and some fatalities have occurred. Experts point out, however, that the mixed breed known as the killer bee is actually not at all as aggressive as the pure African bee. <strong>They (B3) <\/strong>also point out that the attacks have a chemical cause. A killer bee stings only when it has been disturbed; it is not aggressive by nature'. However, after a disturbed bee stings and flies away, it leaves its stinger embedded in the victim. In the vicera attached to the embedded stinger is the chemical isoamyl acetate, which has an odor that attracts other bees.
